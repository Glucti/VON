Von, Von Huh? What? (start the program) 
Just got some top, from this stripper bitch, she from <variable> (init a variable)
Now I'm like, <value of variable>, I hopped out so quick, then I raised my blick. 

Told that bitch <variable>, cuz she lookin' confused (print the variable) 

VON <var> <num> (add a number to the variable) 
HUH? <var> <num> (subtract a number from the variable) 

He don't want no smoke, boy, he not bulletproof (end program)
